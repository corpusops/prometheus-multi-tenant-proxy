=======================================================
While this repository has been inactive for some time, this formal notice, issued on **December 10, 2024**, serves as the official declaration to clarify the situation. Consequently, this repository and all associated resources (including related projects, code, documentation, and distributed packages such as Docker images, PyPI packages, etc.) are now explicitly declared **unmaintained** and **abandoned**.

I would like to remind everyone that this project’s free license has always been based on the principle that the software is provided "AS-IS", without any warranty or expectation of liability or maintenance from the maintainer.
As such, it is used solely at the user's own risk, with no warranty or liability from the maintainer, including but not limited to any damages arising from its use.

Due to the enactment of the Cyber Resilience Act (EU Regulation 2024/2847), which significantly alters the regulatory framework, including penalties of up to €15M, combined with its demands for **unpaid** and **indefinite** liability, it has become untenable for me to continue maintaining all my Open Source Projects as a natural person.
The new regulations impose personal liability risks and create an unacceptable burden, regardless of my personal situation now or in the future, particularly when the work is done voluntarily and without compensation.

**No further technical support, updates (including security patches), or maintenance, of any kind, will be provided.**

These resources may remain online, but solely for public archiving, documentation, and educational purposes.

Users are strongly advised not to use these resources in any active or production-related projects, and to seek alternative solutions that comply with the new legal requirements (EU CRA).

This project has been transfered to Makina Corpus <freesoftware-corpus.com> ( https://makina-corpus.com ). This project and its associated resources, including published resources related to this project (e.g., from PyPI, Docker Hub, GitHub, etc.), may be removed starting **March 15, 2025**, especially if the CRA’s risks remain disproportionate.

------

This project aims to make it easy to deploy a [Prometheus Server](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus)
in a multi-tenant way.

This project has some reference from the [prometheus label injector](https://github.com/prometheus-community/prom-label-proxy)

The proxy enforces the `namespace` label in a given PromQL query while providing a basic auth layer.

## What is it?

It is a simple golang proxy. It does basic auth, logs the requests, and serves as a Prometheus reverse proxy.

Actually, [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus) does not check the auth of any request.
By itself, it does not provide any multi-tenant mechanism. So, if you have untrusted tenants,
you have to ensure a tenant uses its labels and does not use any other tenants' value.

### Requirements

To use this project, place the proxy in front of your [Prometheus server](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus)
instance, configure the auth proxy configuration and run it.

### Run it

```bash
$ prometheus-multi-tenant-proxy run --prometheus-endpoint http://localhost:9090 --port 9091 --auth-config ./my-auth-config.yaml --reload-interval=5
```

Where:

- `--port`: Port used to expose this proxy.
- `--prometheus-endpoint`: URL of your Prometheus instance.
- `--auth-config`: Authentication configuration file path.
- `--reload-interval`: Interval in minutes to reload the auth config file.

#### Configure the proxy

The auth configuration is straightforward. Just create a YAML file `my-auth-config.yaml` with the following structure:

```golang
// Authn Contains a list of users
type Authn struct {
	Users []User `yaml:"users"`
}

// User Identifies a user including the tenant
type User struct {
	Username  string `yaml:"username"`
	Password  string `yaml:"password"`
	Namespace string `yaml:"namespace"`
}
```

An example is available at [configs/multiple.user.yaml](configs/multiple.user.yaml) file:

```yaml
users:
  - username: User-a
    password: pass-a
    namespace: tenant-a
  - username: User-b
    password: pass-b
    namespace: tenant-b
```

A tenant can contain multiple users. But a user is tied to a simple tenant.
